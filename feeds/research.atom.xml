I wrote a paper on sequential permutation test with Tim Bancroft and Dan Nettleton. 
The paper "T. Bancroft, C. Du and D. Nettleton (2012). 
Estimation of False Discovery Rate Using Sequential Permutation PÂ­Values." 
has been accepted by Biometrics. To illustrate ideas in the paper and make sequential 
permutation test easier to use, I wrote an R package &lt;strong&gt;dclong.spt&lt;/strong&gt; which is availabe 
on &lt;a href="https://github.com/dclong/dclong.spt"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. In order to make the package smaller, 
I moved these big datasets (used for illustrations in the paper) from the package to this website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data &lt;a href="http://dclong.github.io/media/spt/marker.rda"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt; was produced by experiment 
"Genetic regulation of gene expression of barley in response
to stem rust (Pgt isolate TTKS)" and can be access from PLEXdb (BB64). 
There is a file called "BB64_RMA_tmt_medians.txt" on the download page contains RMA expressions. 
The rma expression for the 75 chips involve fungas infection is the dataset barley in this package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Band T-cell Acute Lymphocyctic Leukemia (ALL) data set can be 
access via the Bioconductor ALL package at &lt;www.bioconductor.org&gt;. 
Measures of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) commonly referred to as expression levels
are available for 12,625 probesets in 128 ALL patients.
Of these 128 patients, we focus on the 21 males who have been classified as having a translocation
between chromosomes 9 and 22 (BCR/ABL) and the 5 males who have a translocation between
chromosomes 4 and 11 (ALL1/AF4). 
This subset of data is the &lt;a href="http://dclong.github.io/media/spt/leukemia.rda"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt; used in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists genetically mutated/changed the genotypes of barley. 
They could not change everywhere, so they changed 378 positions on the chromosome of barley. 
In the map, "A" and "B" are two types (sort of open and close). 
Because they know where the mutations are, they called them "markers"
(so that if a barley with a certain genotype has a higher expression level, then you may infer and
say, oh that may be caused by the 145th marker, etc.). 
The map has 7 chromosomes of barley, 1H, 2H, ..., 7H. 
These numbers are locations of markers on the chromosomes, like coordinates. 
There are some missing values in the original map, a naive method was used to interpolate the missing
values and produced this dataset &lt;a href="http://dclong.github.io/media/spt/marker.rda"&gt;marker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="research"></category><category term="sequential permutation test"></category><category term="biostatistics"></category><category term="Acute Lymphocyctic Leukemia"></category><category term="package"></category><category term="marker"></category><category term="dclong.spt"></category><category term="R"></category><category term="barley"></category></entry><entry><title>Good Ways to Do Scientific Computing</title><link href="http://lisafly.github.io/blog/good-ways-scientific-computing/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Chuanlong (Ben) Du</name></author><id>tag:lisafly.github.io,2012-06-05:blog/good-ways-scientific-computing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save important intermediate results. It can happen that you did right from
step A to B, but messed up from step B to C. If you save the intermediate
results that step B to C needs, you can resume the work faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use good and consistent way to name objects if you use scripting language
(e.g., R). If your proeject is a big one and takes a long time to do, you had
better plan a continuable way for your work. You do not want to come back to
your project several days later and get confused about work you have done
before. When you name files storing results, a clear name is prefer though it is
long. Or at least you should organize in hierarchical directories. 
Another way to keep your work clear, is to organize object belong a a similar
work together. For example, if you have to do work A and B, both of which are
related to many datasets and objects. You can create two lists (or similar data
structure) and put all datasets and objects related to A into one list and datasets
and objects related to B into the other one. In this way, you keep the workspace
clean, which makes you productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing help documents for functions you wrote and keep a "readme" file for you project. 
You can put work you did, 
work you have to do and ideas related to the project into the "readme" document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use seeds when you generating random numbers. This helps reproducing work you
did before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test your simulation using a faily small dataset or complexity degree to estimate 
the time needed to run bigger simulations. 
If a simulation takes a very long time to run, it is a good idea to&lt;br /&gt;
continuingly update the progress of the simulation after, say, a fixed number of iterations. 
Printing time and summary of results based on currently progress is alwasy benefitial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Here I list some useful properties of them for future reference. 
    $$I_0'(x) = I_1(x)$$
    $$I_1'(x) = \frac{I_0(x)+I_2(x)}{2} $$
    $$\frac{I_1(x)}{I_0(x)}\uparrow \Leftrightarrow I_0(x)(I_0(x)+I_2(x))-2I_1^2(x)&amp;gt;0,\forall x&amp;gt;0$$
    $$\frac{I_1(x)-I_2(x)}{I_0(x)-I_1(x)}\uparrow$$
where $I_n(x)$ is the modified Bessel function of order $n$.&lt;/p&gt;
